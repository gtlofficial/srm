    text: "We were looking for a reliable safe car for my son who has just passed his test. From the moment we were in touch with Ali and the team, we had the best experience ever. We went to look at the car, which was a fantastic car, with all the criteria we were searching for. Nothing was a problem for Ali, and we put a deposit on that day. When we returned to collect the car it had been MOTd and a full service and valet. It was immaculate. As a parent it was essential we purchased from someone trustworthy and Ali is exactly this. The car has been fantastic and it puts my mind at ease that my son is driving a great car. I have and will continue to recommend this business for all my sons friends parents as they pass their tests. Cannot recommend highly enough.",
